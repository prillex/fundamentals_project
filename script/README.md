## Script
This folder is comprised of coding scripts that produced my models and figures. This includes the code used to filter the data to my species.

'initial_script' contains foundational work for the report. It is a collection of very rough notes and models, both linear and bayesian. It is a brainstorm workflow.

'model_selection_process' is a collection of 3 Bayesian models that were not chosen as the final model due to either under-complexity or over-complexity. (Also contains model comparison including final model)

'final_model_script' is the model I used for my report. It also contains the models summary and posterior distribution plot.
